## Control Plan and Members Roll Configuration

Configure Control Plane including

* Configure Control Plane
* Configure project(s) or namespace(s) to be part of Service Mesh
  
Overall steps including
* Create project for ControlPlane. Normally named istio-system.
  Remark: For this lab will be ${USERID}-istio-system
* Creating and managing a ServiceMeshControlPlane resource to deploy the Service Mesh control plane
* Creating a ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource to specify the namespaces associated with the Service Mesh.

Following command line tools are needed for lab

* OpenShift Command Line Interface (CLI - oc command) 
* cURLs
* git (optional)
  
OpenShift Web Console provided link in the top right of page to download oc command here.

![Download oc tool](../images/openshift-console-download-oc.png)

You can  also  download oc tool and cURL for OSX and Windows here => [Link](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArOxOqm_sB7DiSYninA0Aqd6a-kU?e=zsJMGn)

## Setup

### Lab Configuration

* Setup environment variables
```bash
export USERID=<your user ID> 
```

* For Windows
```bash
set USERID=<your user ID>
```

* Login to OpenShift with oc command by
```bash
oc login --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true --username=$USERID --server=<URL to OpenShift API> --username=${USERID} --password=<password>
```

* For Windows
```bash
oc login --username=%USERID% --server=<URL to OpenShift API> 
```

* Use your browser to open OpenShift Web Admin Console and login with your User ID. To display console URL
```bash
oc whoami --show-console
```

### Labs Content

Clone labs content to your working directory. Open your terminal (For OSX terminal, iTerm2, etc and CMD for Windows) then run following command

Link to lab repository [Service Mesh Workshop](https://github.com/vietstacker/Red-Hat-Service-Mesh-Demo)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vietstacker/Red-Hat-Service-Mesh-Demo
```
All the yaml files of this demo are stored within this repository. You can use them as references.

### Projects for Control Plane and Demo Apps

Create projects (namespace) for Service Mesh Control Plane and your applications (for testing). "$USERID-istio-system" project will be used for Service Mesh Control Plane and "$USERID" project will be used for testing.

```bash
oc new-project $USERID-istio-system --display-name="$USERID Istio System"
oc new-project $USERID 
#or use following shell script
scripts/create-project.sh
```

You can also use OpenShift Web Admin Console to create Project by select new project from top-left menu then create your project
**Remark: replace user1 with your user ID**

* Demo applications

## Create Service Mesh Control Plane

Now that the Service Mesh Operator has been installed, you can now install a Service Mesh control plane.
The previously installed Service Mesh operator watches for a ServiceMeshControlPlane resource in all namespaces. Based on the configurations defined in that ServiceMeshControlPlane, the operator creates the Service Mesh control plane.

In this section of the lab, you define a ServiceMeshControlPlane and apply it to your **$USERID-istio-system namespace**.
 
* Install Control Plane using the custom resource file [basic install](../install/basic-install.yml)
    - Mutual TLS in Istio is disbled by setting mtls to false.
    - Kiali user is single sign-on with OpenShift
* Create the service mesh control plane in the $USERID-istio-system project from [basic-install.yml](../install/basic-install.yml) by using Service Mesh's CRDs to control plane project. By default, if user uses Openshift Console Web UI to create Service Mesh Control Plane, the yaml file is provided with value of namespace is "default". This value can be configured and in order to explain the flexibility, in this demo, user will use $USERID-istio-system for namespace.
  
  ```bash
  oc apply -f install/basic-install.yml -n $USERID-istio-system

  #or use following bash script
  scripts/create-control-plane.sh
  ```
  
  By Web Console, navigate to: Operators -> Installed Operators then select Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh

  ![](../images/select-openshift-service-mesh.png)

  Select Create Instance under Istio Service Mesh Control Plane

  ![](../images/create-control-plane.png)

  Copy and paste custom resource file [basic install](../install/basic-install.yml) to YAML section then click Create

  ![](../images/create-control-plane-yaml.png)


* Watch the progress of deployment
  ```bash
  watch oc get pods -n $USERID-istio-system
  #Sample output show deployment is on progress
  NAME                             READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
  istio-citadel-7dd77f956f-9rc9j   1/1     Running             0          42s
  istio-galley-7b644dc96c-w9p7h    0/1     ContainerCreating   0          1s
  jaeger-68dc8cdbb-9v4cp           0/2     ContainerCreating   0          2s
  prometheus-68b8b9b68f-9hbgm      2/2     Running             0          28s
  ```
  
  The entire installation process can take approximately 5-10 minutes. Confirm that following pods are up and running
  
  ![watch istio pods](../images/watch-oc-get-pods-istio-system.png)

  Watch pods by Web Console, naviage to: Workloads -> Pods

  ![watch istio pods web console](../images/watch-pods-istio-system.png)

**Remark: Total number of pods is 12**

Verify control plane installation

```bash
oc get smcp -n ${USERID}-istio-system
```

Sample output

```bash
NAME            READY   STATUS              TEMPLATE   VERSION   AGE
basic-install   9/9     InstallSuccessful   default    v1.1      6m48s
```

## Service Mesh Member Roll

The Service Mesh operator has created an instance of control plane configured for multitenancy as we have finished previous steps. This installation reduces the scope of the control plane to only those projects/namespaces listed in a ServiceMeshMemberRoll.

In this section of the lab, you create a ServiceMeshMemberRoll resource with the project/namespaces you wish to be part of the mesh. This ServiceMeshMemberRoll is required to be named default and exist in the same namespace where the ServiceMeshControlPlane resource resides (ie: $USERID-istio-system).

Sample Service Mesh Member Roll [Member Roll](../install/memberroll.yml) for project name "userX". In this demo, "userX" is the value of $USERID which we have created previously. Create a yaml file as below and apply it into $USERID-istio-system namespace.

**Remark: You need to change member to your User ID e.g. ${USERID}**

```yaml
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  members:
  - userX
```

Or you can use a pre-prepared file to create Service Mesh Member Roll as below. Remark that you need to change member in [install/member.yml](../install/memberroll.yml) to your user ID before create member roll.

```bash
oc apply -f install/memberroll.yml -n $USERID-istio-system

```
Or use the pre-prepared shell script to create Member Roll (This shell script required environment variable $USERID)

```bash
scripts/create-member-roll.sh
# Remark: this shell script use sed with OSX's style parameter
# Edit comment if you are on linux
```

Verify status of member roll

```bash
oc get smmr -n ${USERID}-istio-system
```

Sample output

```bash
NAME      READY   STATUS       AGE
default   1/1     Configured   88s
```


<!-- By Web Console, navigate to: Operators -> Installed Operators then select Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh and Select Create Instance under Istio Service Member Roll
Change member to your User ID (:ie user1) then select Create

Verify that member roll is created
